# Discord TOC
_A discord bot implementation using discordie to automatically create a table of contents for configured channels_

Currently WIP. Finished before BER. **Promise.**

## Getting started

### Create a Discord bot application and invite Bot to your Server

_to be added_

### Initiate Config

Copy `config/config_tpl.json` to `config/config.json` and add your bots access token

### Test bot Connection

After initiating your config file start the test script `node test`. You will get a prompt if your bot successfully connected to your server. After that type `toc!hello` in any discord channel the bot is able to read. The bot will answer with on Discord and the test script will initiate disconnect and exit.
